    <h2>Who I Am</h2>
      <h3>I am a software engineer with a passion first and foremost for <b>people</b>.</h3>
        <p>Before my career as an engineer, I spent years in the customer service industry. Bad customer service always bothers me, and that includes digitally. Inconsiderate UI/UX can ruin someone's day. Let's fix that.
        <br><br> This also shows itself in how I perform as an employee. I hear the term "empathetic engineering," thrown around often, but how often is it applied in its truest sense? I want others to feel welcome, 
        appreciated, seen, and heard.<br> </p>
        <br>
      <h3>Beyond that, I am an engineer characterized by <b>curiosity</b>.</h3>
        <p>I am not satisfied with the surface level. <br><br>
          I don't use React because it's popular, or because it's what I was taught (actually I'm not even a big fan of React, but that's for another time). It is a tool, and I use it only when I have a problem that it solves.<br><br>
          Engineering seems to be facing a crisis in which novice engineers are often abandoning fundamentals, reaching for a framework because "that's just what you do." While I love using them, I'm not satisfied with just knowing frameworks, or even languages; I want to know why they work. <br><br>
          I don't want to stop at "under the hood," I want to dive down into the pistons of the engine.
